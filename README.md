# About
A program that automatically logs you into any current game made by Riot Games. This includes League of Legends, Legends of Runeterra and Valorant.
# Recommended settings
It's recommended to use 1920x1080 resolution when using the app, since some values are set as flat values and don't use coefficients.
The program was created on Python 3.8.5, so that's the known-to-work version.
